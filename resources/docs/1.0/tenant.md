- [Single Database](#section-1)

Multi-tenant architectures are the industry standard for enterprise SaaS applications, it is a good choice for businesses that want to get started with fewer hardware requirements and easier onboarding. It is also ideal for customers who donâ€™t have the internal resources needed to handle the maintenance requirements of single tenant SaaS environments.

### Single Database Multi-tenancy

When using the "single database" version, data from all tenants will be gathered into a single database and separated by columns containing tenantID's.

SaasWeb using this approach and Tenant relationships are handled automatically.

### Model setup
For using single databse multi-tenancy call `ForTenants` trait on a model

```php 
use CreatyDev\App\Tenant\Traits\ForTenants;

class Project extends Model
{
    use ForTenants;
}
```
### Tenants CRUD Operations
By adding `ForTenants` trait on a model. you can now call CRUD operations directly.

```php 
$todos = Todo::create([
    'name' => 'Todo name'
]);
$todos = Todo::get();
```
### Normal CRUD Operations
SaaSWeb gives you ability to fetch data to perform normal CRUD operations on models with `ForTenants` trait.
To do so, you can use `withoutForTenants` scope when fetching records associated with that model.

> {warning} For example this operations can be done on: admin dashboard.

```php 
$todos = Todo::withoutForTenants()->get();
```

### Routing

All `tenant` routes are under the routes folder in the `tenant.php` file.

> {info} Tenant routes placed separately, is much easier to know which routes are for tenants.
