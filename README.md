## installation
1. Fork, clone or download this repository.
2. Run `composer install` if its the initial setup or `composer update`.
3. Setup your environment keys in .env 
    (*If .env does not exist then copy / rename .env.example as .env*)
4. Run `php artisan app:name` to set the name (namespace) of your app. 
    (*Remember not to live any spaces*)
5. Run `php artisan migrate` for initial tables setup.
6. __Optional:__ Run `php artisan db:seed --class=RoleTableSeeder` to set the initial 
    roles and permissions, then follow `step 7` below to assign a user the initial permissions and roles.
7. __Optional:__ To create a `super / root` admin; 
    Run `php artisan admin:assign-role youremail@example.org admin-root`. 
    Substitute `youremail@example.org` with an existing user email. `admin-root` is the __default root Admin role__. 
    
    __Note:__ You must follow `step 6` above first to setup the root admin.


## usage
### Custom Commands
1. __Admin: _Assign user a role___
    - Use `php artisan admin:assign-role <email> <role-slug>`: 
    `<email>` is the user's email and `<role-slug>` is the _slug of the role_ you wish to assign the user.

### Force HTTPS
When pushing the project to a platform or production environment, 
assets or urls may be broken if the platform enforces HTTPS.
 
To enable urls to use HTTPS:

Set `FORCE_HTTPS` variable in `.env` file to `true`. 

By default `FORCE_HTTPS` is `false`.

```Note: ``` If `FORCE_HTTPS` does not exist in your `.env`, 
just add it as a new variable and assign a boolean value `true` or `false`.

This dynamically tells Laravel to force urls to use HTTPS which is especially 
handy in fixing or preventing  broken assets urls.

### Single Database Multi-tenancy
#### Model setup
To start using single databse multi-tenancy call `ForTenants` trait on a model
```php
use SAASBoilerplate\App\Tenant\Traits\ForTenants;

class Project extends Model
{
    use ForTenants;
}
```

#### Tenants CRUD Operations
Once you have setup the model as show above. `Just call CRUD operations directly`. 
`Tenant` relationships are handled automatically.

```php
$projects = Project::create([
    'name' => 'Project 1'
]);
$projects = Project::get();
```

#### Normal CRUD Operations
To perform CRUD operations on models with `ForTenants` trait can be done by 
adding `withoutForTenants` scope when fetching records associated with that model.

```php
$projects = Project::withoutForTenants()->get();
```

***This comes in handy for example in: admin or moderation operations***

#### Routing
All `tenant` routes are under the routes folder in the `tenant.php` file.

Note: ***Tenant routes follow the same structure as other routes***

`The main reason we place all tenant routes separately is to handle route binding and
its much easier to know which routes are for tenants.`
